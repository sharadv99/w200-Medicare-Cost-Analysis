Brief Description
-----
This project explores variations in hospital provider charges and procedures covered for Medicare patients across the country using descriptive statistics. It focuses on an FY 2011 dataset that contains 163,000 hospital-charges for approximately 3,000 U.S. hospitals that receive Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) payments.

The analysis conducted by the team provides answers the following questions:

- What medical conditions do patients visit hospitals for the most / least?
- What medical conditions are covered by hospitals most and least frequently?
- What’s the difference between what hospitals charge, what they receive, and what Medicare pays?
- Which providers charge the highest amount of covered charges?
- How do hospital payments vary by state? 
- To what extent do various population demographics affect hospital payments?
- Which state has the highest density of providers?
- Which state’s providers cover the most medical conditions on average?
- Are there economies of scale in Healthcare

For a comprehensive understanding of the team's analysis, please see the [full report](https://github.com/sharadv99/w200-Medicare-Cost-Analysis/blob/master/EDA_Medicare_Report.pdf)

In addition to answering the research questions above, the team built a [tool](https://github.com/sharadv99/w200-Medicare-Cost-Analysis/blob/master/Medicare_Provider_Search_Tool.ipynb) to search for Medicare providers that treat a specific medical condition within a given radius of a user’s zip code, returning results from least-to-most costly.
